# Introduction

Welcome to Panda! If you're here for the first time, I'm sure you've got questions, so let's dig in...

## What is Panda?

Panda is a Node.js project designed to help developers design, build and deploy _anything_.

Modern software development is about choosing the right tools, processes and patterns, and then putting them all together. Instead of spending time on the tedious tasks, Panda aims to get you into the fun aspects of development as quickly and easily as possible.

At its core, Panda is a development system that creates abstract patterned libraries (called "entities") that can be used independently or bundled together to create larger systems or projects. It uses best-in-class libraries as a foundation for each entity, but the abstraction of functionality allows for the creation of parallel entities built using similar libraries or frameworks.
