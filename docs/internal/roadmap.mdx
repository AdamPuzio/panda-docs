# Roadmap

## On the Horizon

### Dropping Native CommonJS Support

The Panda library currently supports both ESM and CommonJS, but this causes bloat in the library. 

[Experimental support allowing ESM to but `require`d in CommonJS](https://joyeecheung.github.io/blog/2024/03/18/require-esm-in-node-js/) will allow us to drop native CommonJS support and reduce the size of the library.
