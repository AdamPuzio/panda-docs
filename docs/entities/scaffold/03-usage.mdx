# Usage

```js
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'

new Scaffold({
  // required: name
  name: 'create-foo',
  // used as the command called when it's a subcommand
  command: 'foo:create',
  // used in help menu
  description: 'Create a new Foo',
  // application or command version
  version: '1.4.7',
  // argument handler
  //   if object, 'name' data key contains a single or multiple values
  //   if array, data keys are applied as positional arguments
  arguments: {
    name: 'name'
  },
  // list of options to parse
  options: [],
  // list of flags to parse
  flags: [],
  // list of subcommands
  //   if array, use the `command` property as the subcommand
  //   if object, use the key as the subcommand
  subcommands: [],
  // list of prompts to ask user
  prompts: [],
  // list of custom prompt types available to `prompts`
  promptTypes: {},
  // directory where scaffolds are stored
  scaffoldDir: 'scaffolds',
  // current working directory
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  // title of the scaffold
  title: 'Create a Foo',
  // flag to automatically generate and display help menu on --help
  autoHelp: true,
  // flag to automatically output version on --version
  autoVersion: true,
  // flag to suppress logging output
  silent: false,
  // method to transform data before reaching action
  transform: async (data) => {
    data.type = 'based'
    return data
  },
  action: async (data, details) => {
    // perform your actions
  },
  actions: [
    // list of actions to perform
  ],
  actionTypes: {
    // list of custom action types available to `actions`
  }
})
```

## Properties

To learn more about scaffold properties, see the [Properties](/docs/entities/scaffold/properties) documentation.

## Actions

Scaffolds differ from commands in that, instead of a single `action` method, they usually contain a list of `actions` to perform. Actions defined in the `actions` property of the scaffold are performed in the order they should be executed.

:::note

By default, the `action` method already exists and is used to process the actions. You can choose to override this method with your own implementation, but you must call the `runActions` method (or `super.action`) to execute the actions.

To learn more about actions available to scaffolds, see the [Actions](/docs/category/actions).

To learn more about creating new actions, see the [Action documentation](../action/overview).
