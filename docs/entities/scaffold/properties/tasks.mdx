# `tasks`

> **Type:** `array`\
> **Required:** No

A list of tasks to perform when the scaffold is run. Each task represents an action and is run in the order they are defined in the list.

The `type` property defines which action to run. There are two types of actions: built-in actions and custom actions.

## Usage

```js
{
  tasks: [
    {
      type: 'custom',
      handler: async (data) => {
        console.log('Running custom logic')
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Properties

Each action has their own set of properties, but there are a few properties that are common to all actions.

For a list of actions and their properties, see [Scaffold Actions](/docs/entities/scaffold/actions).

| Name     | Description | Default | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- |
| `type`   | The type of action to run |         | Yes      |
| `title`  | The title of the task |         | No       |
| `description` | A description of the task |         | No       |
| `successMessage` | A message to display when the task is successful |         | No       |
| `failureMessage` | A message to display when the task fails |         | No       |
| `silent` | Whether to suppress output from the task | `false` | No       |
| `source` | The relative source path |         | No       |
| `target` | The relative target path |         | No       |
| `sourceBase` | The base source path (overrides scaffold's `scaffoldDir`) |         | No       |
| `targetBase` | The base target path (overrides scaffold's `cwd`) |         | No       |

### `type`

Type: `string`

The type of action to run. This can be a built-in action or a custom action.

### `title`

Type: `string`

The title of the task. This is used in the output to describe the task.

### `description`

Type: `string`

A description of the task. This is currently not used, but may be used in the future.

### `successMessage`

Type: `string`

A message to display when the task is successful. This is used in the output to indicate that the task was successful.

### `failureMessage`

Type: `string`

A message to display when the task fails. This is used in the output to indicate that the task failed.

### `silent`

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Whether to suppress output from the task. If `true`, the task will not output anything to the console unless it fails.

### `source`

Type: `string`

The relative source path. This is used in actions that reference a source file or directory.

### `target`

Type: `string`

The relative target path. This is used in actions that reference a target file or directory.

### `sourceBase`

Type: `string`

The base source path. This overrides the scaffold's `scaffoldDir` property and is used in actions that reference a source file or directory.

### `targetBase`

Type: `string`

The base target path. This overrides the scaffold's `cwd` property and is used in actions that reference a target file or directory.

## Task Groups

Tasks can also be run in groups. This is useful when you want to group related tasks together.

```js
{
  tasks: [
    {
      title: 'Group 1',
      tasks: [
        {
          type: 'custom',
          handler: async (data) => {
            console.log('Running task 1')
          }
        },
        {
          type: 'custom',
          handler: async (data) => {
            console.log('Running task 2')
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Task Group Properties

| Name     | Description | Default | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- |
| `title`  | The title of the task group |         | No       |
| `tasks`  | The list of tasks to run |         | Yes      |
| `concurrent` | Whether to run the task concurrently | `false` | No       |
| `silent` | Whether to suppress output from all subtasks | `false` | No       |
| `collapseSubtasks` | Whether to collapse subtasks in the output after completion | `false` | No       |

##### `title`

Type: `string`

The title of the task group. This is used in the output to describe the task group.

##### `tasks`

Type: `array`

The list of tasks to run. Each task is an object with its own set of properties.

##### `concurrent`

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Whether to run the task concurrently. If `true`, the tasks will run concurrently.

##### `silent`

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Whether to suppress output from all subtasks. If `true`, the subtasks will not output anything to the console unless they fail.

##### `collapseSubtasks`

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

Whether to collapse subtasks in the output after completion. If `true`, the subtasks will be hidden in the output after they complete.

## Built-in Actions

Built-in actions are actions that are provided by Panda. They are defined in the `@pandajs/scaffold` package and are available to all scaffolds.

For a list of built-in actions, see [Scaffold Actions](/docs/entities/scaffold/actions).

## Custom Actions

Custom actions are actions that are defined by the scaffold author. They are defined in the `actionTypes` property of the scaffold.

## Examples

### Basic Task

```js
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'

new Scaffold({
  tasks: [
    {
      type: 'custom',
      handler: async (data) => {
        console.log('Running custom logic')
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

### Task with Source and Target

```js
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'

new Scaffold({
  tasks: [
    {
      type: 'file:copy',
      source: 'path/to/source',
      target: 'path/to/target'
    }
  ]
})
```

### Task Group

```js
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'

new Scaffold({
  tasks: [
    {
      title: 'Group 1',
      tasks: [
        {
          type: 'custom',
          handler: async (data) => {
            console.log('Running task 1')
          }
        },
        {
          type: 'custom',
          handler: async (data) => {
            console.log('Running task 2')
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

### Concurrency

```js
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'

new Scaffold({
  concurrent: true,
  tasks: [
    {
      type: 'custom',
      handler: async (data) => {
        // Custom logic
      }
    },
    {
      type: 'custom',
      handler: async (data) => {
        // Custom logic
      }
    }
  ]
})

```

### Task Group Concurrency

```js
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'

new Scaffold({
  tasks: [
    {
      title: 'Group 1',
      concurrent: true,
      tasks: [
        {
          type: 'custom',
          handler: async (data) => {
            console.log('Running task 1')
          }
        },
        {
          type: 'custom',
          handler: async (data) => {
            console.log('Running task 2')
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

### Silent Task

```js
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'

new Scaffold({
  tasks: [
    {
      type: 'custom',
      handler: async (data) => {
        console.log('Running custom logic')
      },
      silent: true
    }
  ]
})
```
