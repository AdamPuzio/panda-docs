# Installation & Setup

## Installation

### Install Using `@panda/scaffold`

If you _just_ want to use `Scaffold`, you can install it directly from `@panda/scaffold`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @panda/scaffold
```

### Install Using `panda`

The `panda` library contains `Scaffold`, along with a lot of other entities and functionality.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install panda
```

## Setup

### Include

```js
// ESM
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'
// CommonJS
const { Scaffold } = require('@panda/scaffold')
```

### Create

Scaffolds can be creating either by extending the `Scaffold` class or creating a new instance of it.

#### Instantiate Scaffold

```js
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'

const scaffold = new Scaffold({
  name: 'foo:create',
  action: async (data, details) => {}
})
```

#### Extend Scaffold

```js
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'

export const FooCreateScaffold extends Scaffold {
  name = 'foo:create'

  async action (data, details) {}
}
```

### Run

```bash
./my-script.js
```

1. Call the script directly (example: `./my-script.js`)
2. Call the script via `node` (example: `node my-script.js`)
3. Add the script to your `package.json` into `scripts` and run `npm run <script>`
4. Add the script to your `package.json` into `bin` and run `npm link` (or install globally) to run as an independent command

When running a script directly (without using NPM or Node), be sure to include the following in your script:

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
```
