# `autoVersion`

The `autoVersion` property is a boolean value that toggles the automated `--version` flag for a command.

When set to false, the `--version` flag will not be automatically added to the command. This is useful when you want to handle the `--version` flag manually.

> Note: the `version` property is required to trigger the `--version` flag.
