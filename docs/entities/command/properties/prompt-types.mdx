# `promptTypes`

Prompt types are plugins that can be used to create new types of prompts.

## Usage

Prompt types are passed as an array of objects, with each object containing the properties of the prompt type. The new prompt type can be used in `prompts.type`.

Prompt types can be created manually or by including existing implementations. The inquirer library has a list of existing plugins that can be used here.
