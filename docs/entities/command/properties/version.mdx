# `version`

Semantic Version (semver) of either the Command or, most often, the CLI or utility it resides in.

For more information on semantic versioning, see their docs at [semver.org](https://semver.org/).

## `--version` Flag

If `version` is set and the `autoVersion` property isn't set to `false`, running your command with the `--version` (or its alias, `-v`) will output the version:

```js
new Command({
  name: 'my-command',
  version: '0.6.2'
})
```

```bash
$ my-command --version
0.6.2
```

## Common Usage

When building a CLI or a command that contains subcommands, the version is set in the primary command. This will give users an indication of the version of the entire command structure. A common practice is to import/require the project's `package.json` and apply the `version` from there, so it doesn't have to be manually updated in the code.
