# Command

A command is a single, actionable directive that performs a specific task. 

Panda thinks of Commands as a way to collect data from a user (via passed parameters and/or prompts) and execute a task or series of tasks based upon that data.

## Syntax

`<command> [arguments|options|flags] [subcommand] [subcommand-parameters]`

A command is called by a specific name, followed by a series of parameters. These parameters can be in the form of arguments, options, or flags. Additionally, a command can have subcommands.

* parameters
  * arguments
  * options (key=value)
  * flags
  * subcommands

Arguments, options and flags can be called in any order, but subcommands must be called after any base parameters. Any parameters called after a subcommand are considered subcommand parameters.
