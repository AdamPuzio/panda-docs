# Usage

Actions can be run either independently or as part of another entity, such as a Scaffold.

### Using Predefined Actions

```js
const cmd = new CommandAction({
  command: 'echo',
  args: ['hello']
})

cmd.run()
```

### Using Actions in a Scaffold

```js
import { Scaffold } from '@panda/scaffold'

new Scaffold({
  actions: [
    {
      type: 'command',
      command: 'echo',
      args: ['hello']
    }
  ]
})
```
