# Creating Commands

> The goal of this guide is to show you how to use the `Command` library's basic functionality. A more comprehensive guide on creating a full CLI using `@panda/command` can be found in the [Creating a CLI Guide](./cli).

We're going to create a simple command that uses arguments, options, flags and prompts to simulate creating a new file.

## Setup

First, let's create a new NPM project and install the `@panda/command` library:

```bash npm2yarn
mkdir panda-example-command
cd panda-example-command
npm init -y
npm install @panda/command
```

## Create a Command

Next, let's create a new file called `create-file.js` and add the following code:

```js title='create-file.js'
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { Command } from '@panda/command'

const cmd = new Command({
  name: 'file:create',
  arguments: {
    name: 'name'
  },
  options: [
    {
      name: 'log-level',
      description: 'Set the log level',
      tags: ['log']
    },
    {
      name: 'encoding',
      description: 'Set the file encoding',
      default: 'utf-8'
    }
  ],
  flags: [
    {
      name: 'verbose',
      alias: 'v',
      description: 'Run in verbose mode',
      tags: ['log']
    }
  ],
  prompts: [
    {
      name: 'name',
      label: 'Enter the name of the file',
      type: 'input'
    }
  ]
  action: async (data, details) => {
    console.log(`Creating file: ${data.name}`)
    console.log(`Log level: ${data['log-level']}`)
    console.log(`Verbose mode: ${data.verbose}`)
    console.log(`File encoding: ${data.encoding}`)
  }
}).run()
```

Okay, so let's take a look at what this code does:

- We create a new `Command` instance with the name `file:create`.
- We define an argument called `name` that represents the name of the file.
- We define an option called `log-level` that sets the log level.
- We define an option called `encoding` that sets the file encoding with a default value of `utf-8`.
- We define a flag called `verbose` that runs the command in verbose mode (with an alias of `-v`).
- We define a prompt that asks the user to enter the name of the file (if the `name` argument is not provided).
- We define an `action` function that logs the values of the arguments, options, flags and prompts.
- Finally, we call the `run` method to execute the command.



## Run the Command

Now, let's run the command with some arguments, options and flags:

```bash
$ node create-file.js --name=my-file --log-level=debug --verbose
Creating file: my-file
Log level: debug
Verbose mode: true
File encoding: utf-8
```

If you don't provide the `name` argument, the command will prompt you to enter the name of the file:

```bash
$ node create-file.js --log-level=debug --verbose
? Enter the name of the file:
```

You can also run the command with the `-v` flag to enable verbose mode:

```bash
$ node create-file.js --name=my-file -v
Creating file: my-file
Log level: info
Verbose mode: true
File encoding: utf-8
```

## Help

`@panda/command` comes with a built-in help system that you can access by running the command with the `--help` flag:

```bash
$ node create-file.js --help

Usage: file:create [name] [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  name                                  The name of the file

Options:
  --log-level <level>                   Set the log level
  --encoding <encoding>                 Set the file encoding
  -v, --verbose                         Run in verbose mode
  --help                                Show help
```

The help system automatically generates a help message based on the command's arguments, options and flags.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've learned how to create a simple command using the `@panda/command` library. We've covered arguments, options, flags and prompts, and how to run the command with different inputs. We've also seen how to access the built-in help system. In the next guide, we'll learn how to create a full CLI with a primary command and multiple subcommands.
